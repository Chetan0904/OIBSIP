3.Customer Segmentation Techniques:
* Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means clustering) to group customers based on similarity in behavior and characteristics.
* Use dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) if dealing with high-dimensional data.
4.Segmentation Validation:
*  Evaluate and validate customer segments using statistical metrics (e.g., silhouette score for clustering) to ensure meaningful and actionable segmentation.
