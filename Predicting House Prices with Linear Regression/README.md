#Project Title: 
* House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

# Project Overview:
* The house price prediction project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict the selling prices of residential properties based on relevant features.

# Objectives:

* Build and train a linear regression model to predict house prices using a dataset of property attributes and sale prices.
* Identify key features that significantly influence house prices, such as square footage, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, and property type.
* Evaluate the model's performance in terms of predictive accuracy and interpretability.
